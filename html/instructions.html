    During this task, you will be presented with pairs of images, each of which is associated with a certain number of points. <br> In each trial, please select an object. After your selection, points of both objects will be revealed to you.
    <br> The image on the left can be selected using the left arrow key, and the image on the right can be selected using the right arrow key. <br> Your goal is to <strong>maximise the total number of points</strong>.
    <br> The points are associated with the images in a structured way, and they vary from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>100</strong>.
    <br> There are <strong>60</strong> trials in total.
    <br> <br> You will now complete three practice trials. <br> The images and the points of the practice trials are independent from what you will see in the experiment.
    <br> Once you start the actual experiment, your current payment based on your current performance will be shown in each trial.
